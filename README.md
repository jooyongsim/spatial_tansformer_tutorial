# Spatial Transformer Tutorial

This is a tutorial for spatial transformer in Sookmyung Wonmen's Univ's Deep Learning Course 2022 with Prof. Joo Yong Sim

Spatial transformer was published by Google Deepmind: [Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02025.pdf)

## Question: Can we learn how to augment in your network?
- Learn geometric invariance of the model (translation, crop, scale, shear, â€¦ etc)
- Visual attention mechanism
